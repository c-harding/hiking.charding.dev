<meta content="Who fancies a trip to the land of the dragon: Drachenkopf and Drachensee? This is a tough hike, with 1500 m ascent, some Grade I scrambling, and 22 km. It should be very rewarding, with great views over Zugspitze and Drachensee, where we will be able to cool off on the descent." property="og:description">
