<meta content="Let’s do Hiking Buddies’ favourite linear hike, but in reverse! This is a slightly ridgier route, so hopefully there should be good views all day, starting in Tegernsee and ticking off many summits, including Rohrkopf, Baumgartenschneid and Gindelalmschneid. Finally, in Schliersee I plan to have a bit of a picnic, cooking beside the lake." property="og:description">
