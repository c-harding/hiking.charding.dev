#     Salzburg is the furthest east you can reach within the Alps on a Bayern Ticket. From there, we will head west, climbing mountain passes and getting fantastic views of lakes and far-off mountains.

#     Let’s do a big ride orbiting Garmisch! Sights will include Plansee, Zugspitze, Walchensee and Kochelsee. Pace will likely be between 20 and 25 km/h excluding stops, so it should take around six to eight hours plus breaks. I will use a road bike.

    Who fancies a trip to the land of the dragon: Drachenkopf and Drachensee? This is a tough hike, with 1500 m ascent, some Grade I scrambling, and 22 km. It should be very rewarding, with great views over Zugspitze and Drachensee, where we will be able to cool off on the descent.

    Come for a snowy hike in Austria! I have no idea what the conditions on this hike will be like, but I will enquire on Saturday. If it’s impassable, we will reroute, but it would be a shame to spend a day in the mountains without actually mountaineering, so something will definitely go ahead.

    Let’s do Hiking Buddies’ favourite linear hike, but in reverse! This is a slightly ridgier route, so hopefully there should be good views all day, starting in Tegernsee and ticking off many summits, including Rohrkopf, Baumgartenschneid and Gindelalmschneid. Finally, in Schliersee I plan to have a bit of a picnic, cooking beside the lake.

    Let’s embrace the rain/snow/weather, by heading up Hirschberg for (hopefully) a good view of Tegernsee.

    If you enjoy pointless hikes, this is the one for you! It’s the Leading Useless mountain. Depending on time/conditions/how the group is feeling, we could extend to the second summit, Highly Useless/Hochunnütz (it’s lower than Vorderunnütz).

    A chance to explore as many peaks as we can find around the skiing area on the east side of Spitzingsee, finishing up with a swim in Spitzingsee.

    The Ebner Joch (1957 m) is a superb panoramic peak with great views of Achensee, Rofan, Karwendel and the Inn valley. It is quite easy to reach via the Berggasthof Astenau Alpe (1483 m), at which we will stop off on the way back down. At the end, we may also visit the Achensee for a swim.
