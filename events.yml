    Now that summer has arrived, let’s go for a hike up to Hochschrutte followed by a swim in Heiterwanger See. The route is T4, with some grade I scrambling.

    Let’s go to the beautiful Lake Constance by bike! This route crosses the Hochtannbergpass (1578 m) to get from Tyrol into Vorarlberg, before coasting gently downhill for 70 km to Lake Constance (Bodensee).

    Let’s have a nice long day out on the Kramer, with great views of Garmisch and Zugspitze. There is a hut (Stepbergalm) serving great kaiserschmarrn (and I imagine other hut food too), so we will stop there for lunch before our descent.
feldkirchen:
  id: 2758

    There’s a break in the rain forecasted tomorrow around lunchtime, so hopefully there should be enough time to fit a century ride in! I’ve found some good hills over to the south-east of Munich to explore.
platteneck:
  id: 2754
  desc: >-
    This ridgeline is a sort of no man’s land, right on the border with Austria. We will be staying on the German side, but because of this the area is generally under-explored. There are no huts around, and only few paths.
stolzenberg:
  id: 2719
  desc: >-
    This should be a lovely hike among the autumn leaves, around the Spitzingsee ski area. There are three summits without too much ascent/descent between them, and we should get good views south towards Schinder and Sonnwendjoch in the Mangfallgebirge.
zugspitze:

    It’s perfect weather tomorrow for standing on top of Germany! The day will be very long, and very rewarding.

    Before the days get too short, let’s go for an evening ride around the beautiful Ammersee!
hexenkopf:
  id: 983
  desc: >-
    This hike starts less than three hours from Munich, but climbs up to summits of 3004 m (Furgler) and 3035 m (Hexenkopf), higher than anything in Germany! While Furgler is one of the most popular mountains in Austria, Hexenkopf will be much quieter.

    The roads to the north of Munich are nice and quiet, and pass through some lovely sleepy Bavarian villages. This route follows the course of the river Amper upstream, after crossing over the slight ridge from Neufahrn.
salzburg-inntal:

    Salzburg is the furthest east you can reach within the Alps on a Bayern Ticket. From there, we will head west, climbing mountain passes and getting fantastic views of lakes and far-off mountains.

    Let’s do a big ride orbiting Garmisch! Sights will include Plansee, Zugspitze, Walchensee and Kochelsee. Pace will likely be between 20 and 25 km/h excluding stops, so it should take around six to eight hours plus breaks. I will use a road bike.
wildalpjoch:
  id: 834
  desc: >-
    Wendelstein is one of the most recognisable peaks around, and it provides panoramic views over the fields of Bavaria to the north, and so much of the Alps to the south. Wildalpjoch is more wild, and should provide a more peaceful, tourist-free summit. Let's visit both on our journey into the Mangfallgebirge.
drachenkopf:
  id: 793
  desc: >-
    Who fancies a trip to the land of the dragon: Drachenkopf and Drachensee? This is a tough hike, with 1500 m ascent, some Grade I scrambling, and 22 km. It should be very rewarding, with great views over Zugspitze and Drachensee, where we will be able to cool off on the descent.
teufelstaettkopf:
  id: 816
  desc: >-
    Given the bad weather on both Corpus Christi and the following weekend, let's take Monday off and go for a hike in the Ammergau. This should give some great views from rocky peaks, without being too technically challenging.
alpbach:
  id: 671
  desc: >-
    Come for a snowy hike in Austria! I have no idea what the conditions on this hike will be like, but I will enquire on Saturday. If it’s impassable, we will reroute, but it would be a shame to spend a day in the mountains without actually mountaineering, so something will definitely go ahead.
muc-airport-loop:
  id: 710
  desc: >-
    A simple 65 km ride in an anticlockwise circle around the airport. I'll be on a road bike, and I expect the route to entirely be on tarmac.
tegernsee-schliersee:
  id: 648
  desc: >-
    Let’s do Hiking Buddies’ favourite linear hike, but in reverse! This is a slightly ridgier route, so hopefully there should be good views all day, starting in Tegernsee and ticking off many summits, including Rohrkopf, Baumgartenschneid and Gindelalmschneid. Finally, in Schliersee I plan to have a bit of a picnic, cooking beside the lake.
hirschberg:
  id: 647

    Let’s embrace the rain/snow/weather, by heading up Hirschberg for (hopefully) a good view of Tegernsee.

    If you enjoy pointless hikes, this is the one for you! It’s the Leading Useless mountain. Depending on time/conditions/how the group is feeling, we could extend to the second summit, Highly Useless/Hochunnütz (it’s lower than Vorderunnütz).
corno-bianco:
  id: 428
  desc: >-
    A circular hike with two highlights: views into the Bletterbach gorge, part of the Dolomite UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2009, and the ascent of a summit with a panoramic views.
spitzing:
  id: 327

    A chance to explore as many peaks as we can find around the skiing area on the east side of Spitzingsee, finishing up with a swim in Spitzingsee.
reither-spitze:
  id: 276
  desc: >-
    The first hike of the Hiking Awesome Fellows! A gentle explore up Reither Spitze, from Seefeld in Tirol.
ebner-joch:
  id: 765
  desc: >-
    The Ebner Joch (1957 m) is a superb panoramic peak with great views of Achensee, Rofan, Karwendel and the Inn valley. It is quite easy to reach via the Berggasthof Astenau Alpe (1483 m), at which we will stop off on the way back down. At the end, we may also visit the Achensee for a swim.
