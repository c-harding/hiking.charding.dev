    Salzburg is the furthest east you can reach within the Alps on a Bayern Ticket. From there, we will head west, climbing mountain passes and getting fantastic views of lakes and far-off mountains.

    Let's do a big ride orbiting Garmisch! Sights will include Plansee, Zugspitze, Walchensee and Kochelsee. Pace will likely be between 20 and 25 km/h excluding stops, so it should take around six to eight hours plus breaks. I will use a road bike.

    Who fancies a trip to the land of the dragon: Drachenkopf and Drachensee? This is a tough hike, with 1500 m ascent, some Grade I scrambling, and 22 km. It should be very rewarding, with great views over Zugspitze and Drachensee, where we will be able to cool off on the descent.
